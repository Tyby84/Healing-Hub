Segment Massage is similar to deep tissue massage, this treats the reflectory zones within the connective tissue that are related to particular organs. This technique, however, is much gentler.

Segment massage produces a vegetative stimulation of related segments of the skin and connective tissue. This, in turn, regulates blood circulation and function via the segment's cutivisceral connection to the internal organs. The treatment should be continued until the patient's reactions have stabilized.
